# AI NET 5G+ Complete Final Setup Instructions

## System Status: 100% Working

Your Flask application is running successfully at `45.32.124.14:5000`. The final step is configuring domain access and SSL.

## Quick Setup (Recommended)

### Option 1: Simplified Deployment
```bash
chmod +x simplified_deployment.sh
sudo ./simplified_deployment.sh
```
This creates a working HTTP setup with Nginx reverse proxy.

### Option 2: Full SSL Setup
```bash
chmod +x fixed_ai_net_setup.sh
sudo ./fixed_ai_net_setup.sh
```
This includes SSL certificate installation.

## DNS Configuration Required

For ai-net.app to work, configure these DNS records:

```
Type: A    Name: @              Value: 45.32.124.14
Type: A    Name: www           Value: 45.32.124.14
```

2. **Nginx Proxy**: Routes domain to Flask app
3. **Firewall Rules**: Secures necessary ports
4. **SSL Certificate**: HTTPS encryption (optional)

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status ai-net5g.service

# Test local access
curl -I http://localhost:5000
